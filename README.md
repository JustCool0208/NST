# 🎨 Neural Style Transfer App

## Transform any photo into artwork using deep learning and style transfer!

A fast, interactive web app that takes a content image and applies the style of another image (like a famous painting), powered by TensorFlow and Streamlit.

---

### 🚀 Features

- 📷 Upload **any content image** (selfie, scenery, etc.)
- 🖼️ Apply the **style of any image** (e.g., Starry Night, mosaic textures)
- 🎛️ **Adjust style strength** with an intuitive slider
- 🧠 Powered by **TensorFlow Hub's Magenta model** (faster than traditional VGG-based models)
- 💾 **Download the stylized image**
- ✅ **Streamlit-based UI** – fast, clean, and interactive

---

### 🧠 Model Used

- **Google Magenta – Arbitrary Image Stylization v1 (256)**
- [TF Hub Link](https://tfhub.dev/google/magenta/arbitrary-image-stylization-v1-256/2)
- Combines content + style using deep feature matching
- Fast feed-forward stylization
- Trained on **MS-COCO + WikiArt**
